Customer is ready to Un-protect thier sensitive data in RHEL 6 then after migration to RHEL 7 they can protect the same 
Customers are using internal/external block devices normally
Device name are changing frequently or not in customer scenarios
what is the FPDID setup in path_name_info.conf file inside FP installation directory
   Path Name Info Type  (Local) :  2 (<FPDID> + <Path on the Volume>)
   Path Name Info Type (Remote) :  1 (<Remote IP Address> + <Path on the Remote Volume>)
  Path Name Info Volume Setting :  off
  
After migration to RHEL 7 what are the setup they will retain (device names, mount paths, FPDID values, files/folders heirarchy, delegated scripts paths)






1. How they are migrating to RHEL7. Only boot volume they are migrating or they have the brand new machine setup.
   If they are only changing their boot volumes then make sure other partitions and data heirarchy are same.
   
2. "/dev/sda1	yes	volume	hdfs1	/u/applic/data/hdfs1"
   This is the only volume which they are protected by using Volume Protection
   After migration to RHEL 7 device name & mount path wll retain or not. if not, it wont successfully do Volume Encryption on this device

3. Is this internal/external device (/dev/sda1). If it is internal while migration to RHEL 7 it will loose Volume Encryption, where if its connected by externally then 
   device name and mounted path should be same after migration. 

4. Device Name : /dev/sda1
   Mount Point : /boot
   FPDID : FPDID00000018eD001N6BSrFRqiOqUl
			
   I could see this entries in FPDID list. if it is then they protected boot volumes, its not recommended. There is a chance of device name change while restart the system.
   Are they configuring with different ESA and policies (DE's, Roles, With different set of permissions) after migrating to RHEL 7

5. How they are FP/AC protected data's backup and restoring in migration setup.

6. These are the path where AC protected data resides (/opt/app/da, /home, /data/01/.encrypted01) from dfpadmin status. Make sure these data heirarchy will be same 
   after migration to RHEL7.
7. The data is AC protected in RHEL 6 setup whether they only AC protected or AC+FE.
